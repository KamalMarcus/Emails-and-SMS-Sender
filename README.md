# Emails-and-SMS-Sender
This as an Email, and SMS sender application using Java programming language / Netbeans IDE.
It simlply stores your contacts information and sends to them an Email or an SMS message .
I used the sendlySMS api for sending SMSs .
I also used Mandril for sending Emails .
These libraries must be included in the project's classpath so that it can run correctly :
AbsoluteLayout.jar , AESenc.jar (for encryption/decryption , made by me !) , javaee-api-6.0.jar , javax.mail.jar , jdatepicker-1.3.4.jar ,
org-apache-commons-codec.jar , sqlite-jdbc-3.8.10.1.jar . 

If you have any question, please don't hesitate to contact me .
